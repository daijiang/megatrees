Description: There are an increasing number of mega-phylogenies available nowadays,
    with many of them being sets of thousands of posterior distribution phylogenies.
    For ecological studies, we may need to randomly select many such posterior phylogeneies
    to conduct analyses. This data package serves this purpose by providing a small number (100)
    of randomly selected posterior phylogenies (if available) so that we can readily use 
    them for our downstream analyses without repeating the downloading and selecting processes.
