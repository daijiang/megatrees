#' Mega-tree of Plants based on Open Tree of Life
#'
#' This tree was based on Brown and Smith (2018), which in turn was based on the Open Tree of Life.
#' It was copied from `V.PhyloMaker::GBOTB.extended`. After then, node labels were added for empty ones.
#'
#' @format A phylogeny with class "phylo". It is also a list. Compare with a normal phylo object, it has another data frame `tree_plant_otl$genus_family_root`, which provides the root nodes information for every unique genus and family in the phylogeny. Such information can be used to insert new tips onto the phylogeny later.

#' Mega-tree of 11638 Fish from The Fish Tree of Life
#'
#' This tree was generated by Rabosky et al. (2018). It has 11638 tips that all have sequence data. Node labels were added here.

#' 100 Mega-tree of 31516 Fish from The Fish Tree of Life
#'
#' This tree was generated by Rabosky et al. (2018). It has 31516 tips, with species missing sequence data added using birth-death models. Therefore, there are 100 such posterior distribution phylogenies to account for uncertainty. The authors suggested not to use them to conduct trait evolution analyses.

#' @format A phylogeny with class "multiPhylo". It is also a list. Each phylogeny also has another data frame `genus_family_root`, which provides the root nodes information for every unique genus and family in the phylogeny. Such information can be used to insert new tips onto the phylogeny later.
